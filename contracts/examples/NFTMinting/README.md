# DLC NFT Broker Demo

This demo let's users lock Bitcoin into DLCs and mints an NFT to the user representing this Bitcoin contract. The NFT minted to the user will be ERC-721 compatible. In the ERC-721 metadata is the amount of BTC stored in the DLC.

You can find a webapp which runs uses this contract and build a nice simple UX/UI for this flow here: https://github.com/DLC-link/dlc-lending-demo
