# DLC DeFi Lending Demo

This demo let's users lock Bitcoin into DLCs and take a loan of our custom USDC coin against it. The USDC must be repaid before a user can then unlock their Bitcoin.

You can find a webapp which runs uses this contract and build a nice simple UX/UI for this flow here: https://github.com/DLC-link/dlc-lending-demo
